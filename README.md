Create a one player clicker. Have a text view with the total number of clicks, a button to press to increase the clicks, and a "Did you Win?" button. Make the button increase the number of clicks. When you press the "Did you Win?" button and the clicks is over 5, the next screen should display "You Won!!! Total of [NUMBER OF CLICKS] clicks".
